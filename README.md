Particle Auth is a simple self-custodial auth infra for Web3 apps and wallets.

Particle Connect is the best way to onboard any user for your dApp.

Particle Wallet is not an independent walletâ€”it is a wallet infrastructure plugged into apps or wallets.

## Getting Started 

[Auth Doc](https://docs.particle.network/developers/auth-service/sdks/flutter)

flutter pub add particle_wallet
```
```
import 'package:particle_wallet/particle_wallet.dart';
