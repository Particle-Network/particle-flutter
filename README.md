# Particle Flutter SDKs

Particle Auth is a simple self-custodial auth infra for Web3 apps and wallets.

Particle Auth Core combine MPC signature capability and Wallet through Auth Core. In this way, you can control almost all the UI/UX. To simplify this, we also provide out-of-box UI/UX for Custom Auth signing.

Particle Connect is the best way to onboard any user for your dApp.

Particle Wallet is not an independent walletâ€”it is a wallet infrastructure plugged into apps or wallets.

Particle AA support Account Abstraction

## iOS Cocoapods requires

## Getting Started 

[Auth Doc](https://docs.particle.network/developers/auth-service/sdks/flutter)

### Use this package as a library

Depend on it

Run this command:

With Flutter:
```
flutter pub add particle_auth
```
This will add a line like this to your package's pubspec.yaml (and run an implicit flutter pub get):

Import it
Now in your Dart code, you can use:
```
import 'package:particle_auth/particle_auth.dart';
```

Import Connect and Wallet SDKs using the same method

[Connect Doc](https://docs.particle.network/developers/connect-service/sdks/flutter)

```

```
```
import 'package:particle_connect/particle_connect.dart';
```

[Wallet Doc](https://docs.particle.network/developers/wallet-service/sdks/flutter)
