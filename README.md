## Upgrade Guide
If you are using 1.4.x, please review this [Upgrade Guide](https://github.com/Particle-Network/particle-flutter/blob/master/UpgradeGuide.md) from 1.4.x to 1.5.x 

### Note For iOS
Please note that the SDK `particle_auth_core` only supports ios-arm64 (iOS devices), does not support simulators, to perform testing, you will require an actual iPhone device.

Particle Auth Core is a simple self-custodial auth infra for Web3 apps and wallets.

Particle Connect is the best way to onboard any user for your dApp.

Particle Wallet is not an independent walletâ€”it is a wallet infrastructure plugged into apps or wallets.

Particle AA support Account Abstraction
